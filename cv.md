## About me
I decided to switch to the IT field from a different profession because I see great opportunities for career and financial growth.

My goal is to create applications that not only meet the highest standards of quality but also provide the best user experience. To achieve this goal, I constantly strive to learn and discover new things, in order to stay up-to-date with the latest trends and technologies in my field.

Overall, my drive for learning and acquiring new knowledge helps me become a more effective and productive developer.
